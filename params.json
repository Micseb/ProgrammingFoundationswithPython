{"name":"Programming foundations with Python by Udacity","tagline":"Project developed during the course","body":"# Programming Foundations with Python by Udacity\r\n Introductory programming class for Python from Udacity Website\r\n \r\n In this repository you will find the scripts developed during the fantastic Udacity training \r\n[Udacity Python foundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud036)\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Project Take a Break**: Do you know a friend who works too many hours? We will write a program that schedules breaks throughout the day -- reminding your friend to listen to music, get up and dance to their favorite song, or just walk away from the computer every once in awhile. [Take a break](http://youtu.be/C29aerpwkc8)\r\n* **Project Profanity** Editor: Imagine it’s late at night and you get an email from your boss, requesting your help with something. You reply, “I can take a shot at it” but accidentally end up including an awkward word (sh*t). Oops. We will write a python program that detects curse words, and saves clumsy email writers from embarrassing moments. [Project Profanity](http://youtu.be/Rvj2UI-wVXA)\r\n* **Movie Website**: We will learn how to make an awesome webpage that lists your favorite movies and shows their trailers. [Movie Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0FoelOIZM0&t=1m24s )\r\n \r\nYou see the result of the first project here: \r\n[Udacity Movies](http://udacitymovies.mybluemix.net/)\r\n\r\nYou can push it to IBM Bluemix or Cloud Foundry with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncf push -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/nginx-buildpack <appname>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run the Movie Website project, from command line, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython entertainment_center.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate the HTML page and then load it in browser. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n<center>![alt tag](https://github.com/aruizga7/ProgrammingFoundationswithPython/blob/master/movies/screenshot.PNG?raw=true)</center>\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
