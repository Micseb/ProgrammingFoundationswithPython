<ul>
<li>
<strong>Project Take a Break</strong>: Do you know a friend who works too many hours? We will write a program that schedules breaks throughout the day -- reminding your friend to listen to music, get up and dance to their favorite song, or just walk away from the computer every once in awhile. <a href="http://youtu.be/C29aerpwkc8">Take a break</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Profanity</strong> Editor: Imagine it’s late at night and you get an email from your boss, requesting your help with something. You reply, “I can take a shot at it” but accidentally end up including an awkward word (sh*t). Oops. We will write a python program that detects curse words, and saves clumsy email writers from embarrassing moments. <a href="http://youtu.be/Rvj2UI-wVXA">Project Profanity</a>

<li>
<strong>Movie Website</strong>: We will learn how to make an awesome webpage that lists your favorite movies and shows their trailers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0FoelOIZM0&amp;t=1m24s">Movie Website</a>
